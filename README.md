# IoT Enabled Wearable ECG for use in Emergency Department
We collaborated with NUH Emergency Department on a R&D project supervised by Dr Tang Kok Zuea from NUS to develop a wearable, IoT-enabled, automatic 12-lead ECG and respiratory rate monitoring device. The code here is used to program the ESP32 Microcontroller to process data from the Analog Circuitry that collects the ECG data and then send it to our web server.

Demo of the system can be seen here (click photo for link or visit https://youtu.be/t8BiB1zPRh8):
